<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">LENS-GENERAL
INFORMATION</span><span class="c3">- -The LENS section describes
the establishment and manipulation of the lens database. Some of
the commands described here are CMD level commands issued at the
CMD level. These CMD level commands are described here instead of
in the CMD section because they act to modify, or in other ways
manipulate, the lens data base. The other commands described here
are LENS level and UPDATE LENS level commands which can only be
issued at one or both of these levels. Associated with the lens
database are two additional optional databases which may be used
with, and attached to, the lens database. These databases are the
ALTERNATE-CONFIGURATION database and the SPECIAL SURFACE database.
These optional databases are operated upon via the CONFIGS, UPDATE
CONFIGS, SPSRF and UPDATE SPSRF program levels. Alternate lens
configurations are described in the CONFIGS manual section. The
special surface database is described in the SPECIAL SURFACES
manual section. There can be a maximum of 500 surfaces per lens
prescription.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">THE LENS DATABASE</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The lens database consists of an object surface, a
sequence of transmitting, reflecting or diffraction gratting
surfaces and an image surface. (Holographic Optical Surfaces and
other more complex surface types are modeled using SPECIAL SURFACES
definitions). Provision is made for the entry of a number of flat,
spherical, conic, aspheric, &nbsp;toroidal and anamorphic surface
profiles. Glass catalogs with refractive index interpolation
coefficients are provided for most optical materials. These catalog
glasses can be called out by name or &nbsp;glass number as
appropriate. A right-handed rectangular coordinate system (X, Y, Z)
is used throughout the program. Lens surface data is represented in
the local coordinate system of each surface. Surface profile
equations are expressed in these local coordinate systems. The
local coordinate system of a given lens surface becomes the
reference coordinate system for the following surface. For systems
with no tilts or decenters, the Z-axis is the system optical axis.
The "right-handedness" of the coordinate system is strictly
observed with respect to spatial coordinates X, Y and Z and
associated direction cosines L, M and N. The arithmetic sign
convention will be ALPHA and BETA positive "left-handed" and Gamma
positive "right-handed". This angle sign convention is attached to
a particular lens file and is not global to the program. The lens
database is sequential, and surfaces are numbered in the order in
which they are encountered by a ray traveling from the object to
the image surface. The object surface is initially assumed to be
number 0. The object, reference and image surface numbers may be
temporarily reassigned during some ray tracing. A general surface
number will be denoted by "i". Quantities relating to the space
between surfaces "i" and "i+1" will be associated with surface
number "i". There is always a "current lens", though the "current
lens" might not have any surfaces. When the program ends execution,
that "current lens" is automatically stored in the sub-directory
\CURLENS in the file named "LENSTEXT.DAT". The next time the
program is run, that lens is automatically read into the lens
database and is immediately ready for analysis. &nbsp;If tolerance
or optimization definitions exist, they will be stored with the
lens database whenever that lens database is written to disk. These
definitions will then be automatically reloaded when the lens
database is from disk.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">THE LENS POINTER</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The secret to understanding the UPDATE LENS level is
the concept of the update lens pointer. For surface dependent
UPDATE LENS commands, a surface pointer is used to point to the
"current surface". The "CHG" command is used to move this pointer
from surface to surface. Surface dependent commands simply act upon
this "current surface" rather than requiring the surface number as
part of their input syntax. This pointer is quite analogous to the
pointer used in the MACRO section for macro editing. Issuing the
"?" command at any time in the UPDATE LENS level will display the
surface number of the "current surface".</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">REFRACTIVE
INDICES</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Most refractive indices in
this program are assumed to be measured with respect to the
refractive index of air at 760 mm Hg and at 20 degrees Centigrade.
Some special catalog materials comprise data measured at other
temperatures. If a temperature of measurement is not mentioned in
the "GLASSP" output for that particular material, then 760 mm Hg
and 20 degrees Centigrade are assumed. When a vacuum must be
simulated, use the material "VAC" in the "MATL" catalog. It is the
only glass catalog material to have a refractive index less than
1.0 since its refractive index is also represented with respect to
air. The user may use the "THERM" and "PRES" commands described
later in this section to change refractive indices to correct for
other temperatures and pressures.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">ZERO OBJECT
THICKNESS</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The program depends upon a
non-zero object surface thickness as part of the initial ray
aiming. This in no way limits the systems which may be modeled. For
systems in which the object distance is either zero or very small,
use a dummy surface at surface 1. Assign a positive object surface
thickness to surface 0 and an equal but opposite signed thickness
to surface 1 The absolute magnitude of the thickness assigned to
surface 0 should not be less than 0.1 lens units or problems may
occur when computing OPD. If the object distance desired is, for
example, 0.001 lens units, a thickness of 1.001 should be assigned
to surface 0 and a thickness of -1.000 should be assigned to
surface 1.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">CREATING A NEW LENS</span></p>
<p class="c10 c39"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LENS</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "LENS" command causes the program to leave the CMD
level and enter the LENS input level. The lens database is wiped
clean and is ready for lens input. Between "LENS" and "EOS", any
LENS input level command may be entered. The "LENS" command also
wipes clean any optimization and tolerance definitions which were
in effect prior its issuance. If issued with an alphanumeric
string, that string becomes the lens identifier.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">EOS</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">END</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "EOS" or "END" command, issued from the LENS
level, causes the program to return to the CMD level and terminates
lens input. The "lens pointer" is left at the current surface, and
this current surface automatically becomes the "LAST SURFACE" or
image surface of the lens system. The lens database is left in
memory and is ready for analysis.</span></p>

<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">UPDATE LENS</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">U L</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "UPDATE LENS" command, or its abbreviated form "U
L", causes the program to leave the CMD level and enter the UPDATE
LENS level. The lens database is opened and is ready for lens
modification. Between "UPDATE LENS" or "U L" and "EOS" or "END",
any UPDATE LENS level command may be entered.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">INS, i , n</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "INS" command, issued from the UPDATE LENS level,
causes the insertion of a new surface. If "i" is explicitly
entered, the new surface will become the new surface "i". The
previous surface "i" will become the new surface "i+1", and all
surfaces beyond the new inserted surface will have their surface
numbers increased by "1". If "i" is not explicitly entered, "i" is
assumed to be the current value of the update lens pointer. New
surface insertion at surface 0 is not allowed. All PIKUPs, solves,
alternate configuration parameters and special surface definition
values will be properly adjusted. The optional second numeric entry
"n" is a repetition indicator. Its default value is 1. The "INS"
command will be repeated "n" times if "n" is entered explicitly and
if it is greater than 1. The new inserted surface(s) will be
initialized as a plano surface with zero thickness, a material type
of "AIR" and refractive indices all equal to 1.0 or -1.0 depending
upon the existing arrangement of reflecting surfaces in the lens.
This command is only available at configuration #1 (the main
configuration) of a multiple configuration lens.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">DEL, i , j</span><span class=
"c3">The "DEL" command, issued from the UPDATE LENS level, causes
the program to delete a surface. If "i" is explicitly entered, the
"i"th surface will be deleted. The previous surface "i+1" will
become the new surface "i", and all surfaces beyond the deleted
surface will have their surface numbers decreased by "1". If "i" is
not explicitly input, "i" is assumed to be the current value of the
update lens pointer. Surface deletion at surface 0 and at the last
or final surface is not allowed. All PIKUPs, solves, alternate
configuration parameters and special surface definition values will
be properly adjusted. The optional second numeric entry "j" is the
last surface to delete in a range of surfaces "i" to "j". &nbsp;Its
default value is "i". If PIKUPs, solves, alternate configuration
parameters or special surface definition values refer to the
deleted surface, they will be deleted as well. This command is only
available at configuration #1 (the main configuration) of a
multiple configuration lens. Surface insertion and deletion are
rather drastic operations upon a lens prescription and these
operations can cause optimization operands, tolerance operands and
focrit operands which are evaluated for specific surface numbers to
take on unpredictable values. After surface insertion or deletion,
values for all current operands should be checked before
optimization or tolerancing resumes. Surface numbers for
optimization and tolerance variables are automatically adjusted
after surface insertion and deletion.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">CHG, i</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp; - The "CHG" command, issued from the UPDATE LENS level,
causes the update lens pointer to be positioned at surface "i".
Surface "i" is then the "current surface" with respect to all
surface dependent UPDATE LENS commands.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">EOS</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">END</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The command "EOS" or "END", issued from the UPDATE
LENS level, causes the program to return to the CMD level and
terminates the lens update process. The lens database is left in
memory and is ready for analysis. In addition to the closing of the
lens database to input or modification, "EOS" or
"END",</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">issued
at the LENS input and UPDATE LENS levels, causes all PIKUPS and
SOLVES to be resolved and causes a new paraxial raytrace to be
performed.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">ZERO</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The command "ZERO", issued from the UPDATE LENS level,
causes all of the surfaces in the lens database to be converted to
plano surfaces with 0.0 thickness and material type AIR. All lens
database items associated with all surfaces are returned to program
defaults. This command is intended to be issued at the UPDATE LENS
level from within the CONFIGS or UPDATE CONFIGS mode when it is
desired to start adding alternate configuration data to a blank
lens database as when designing using type 13 special surfaces.
This is a very specialized command which should be used with
extreme care. The command is only valid for alternate
configurations. It has no effect upon the main configuration,
configuration #1.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">AUTOMATIC MACRO FUNCTION
EXECUTION</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">AUTOFUNC , n</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "AUTOFUNC" command, issued from the LENS or UPDATE
LENS program levels, allows the user to specify that during the
execution of an "EOS" command from within the LENS and LENS UPDATE
program levels, the macro function "n" will be automatically
executed. "n" may be set to from 0 to 10. If "n" is set to zero, no
macro function will be executed. "n" = 0 is the default. ANYTHING
may be done in this macro function including manipulation of all
lens database items. Provision has been made to avoid any "infinite
looping". This seemingly simple command allows for the
establishment of extremely complex and automatic manipulations of
the lens database including complex user-defined pickups and
solves. It can also be used to execute any other macro, if that
macro is called for execution from within the macro function. If
the "AUTOFUNC" command is issued followed only by a "?", the
current AUTOFUNC setting will be displayed. Issued from the CMD
level, the current AUTOFUNC setting is also displayed.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">LENS INPUT AND UPDATE LENS LEVEL
COMMANDS</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Most LENS input and UPDATE
LENS level commands are the same. The difference in the operation
between the UPDATE LENS level and the LENS input level is in the
concept and operation of the update lens pointer system which has
already been described. At the LENS input level, only sequential,
surface-by-surface input is allowed and no moving pointer is
provided. At the LENS input level, you are always at the current
surface or "LAST SURFACE" of the lens system. The optical material
name used at the final surface of all lens systems is always "LAST
SURFACE". This "LAST SURFACE" optical material name is not entered
by the user but is automatically supplied by the
program.</span></p>
<hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">NON-SURFACE DEPENDENT
COMMANDS</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The following program
commands are non-surface dependent. They refer to the lens database
as a whole:</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LI (lens identifier - up to 79
characters in length)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - The "LI"
command is used to name the current lens in the lens database. This
is the first line of identification. It is the name used during
lens library storage. If the "LI" command is issued followed only
by a "?", the current lens identifier will be displayed. This
command is valid at both the LENS input and the UPDATE LENS levels.
The lens identifier in used to give lenses in the lens library
their labels or names. It is important to assign lens identifiers
to every lens which is to be placed in the lens library with the
"LIB PUT" command. If this is not done, lenses will only be
differentiated by time and date. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3 c14">The default lens identifier
is always "NEW LENS". If the time and/or date stamping option has
been turned on using the CMD level commands "STAMPT" and "STAMPD"
described in the CMD section of this manual, then time and/or date
notations will be appended to the beginning of the lens identifier
whenever the lens identifier is displayed in a textual or graphical
context.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LIC (lens identifier - up to 79
characters in length)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - The "LIC"
command continues the information input initiated by the "LI"
command. Up to four "LIC" commands may be entered providing a
maximum of five lines of lens identification. If more than four
"LIC" commands are issued, the last line will be repeatedly
overwritten. If the "LIC" command is issued followed only by a "?",
the current value of the continued lens identifier will be
displayed. This command is valid at both the LENS input and the
UPDATE LENS levels.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">INI (designer identifier - up to
70 characters)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - The "INI" command is
used to store the designer identifier or name with the current
lens. Up to 70 characters can be used. If the "INI" command is
issued followed only by a "?", the current value of the designer
identifier will be displayed. This command is valid at both the
LENS input and the UPDATE LENS levels.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LTYPE (optical design type
identifier - up to 5 characters)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; -
The "LTYPE" command is used to store the optical design type
identifier with the current lens. Up to 5 characters can be used.
If the "LTYPE" command is issued followed only by a "?", the
current value of the optical design type identifier will be
displayed. This command is valid at both the LENS input and the
UPDATE LENS levels.</span></p>

solve options, the paraxial ray trace, the calculation of 3rd, 5th
and 7th order aberrations of the lens system and the establishment
of initial reference heights for trigonometric ray tracing, the
program requires that an object height at the object surface be
entered. This height may be entered either as a linear measure at
the object surface in lens units or as an object space angle in
degrees. If used, the object space angle is the angle subtended by
the object at surface 0 as seen from surface 1.</span></p>

paraxial entrance pupil which would be located at the point where
the line joining Yo and Y1 intersects the Z-axis. (This would be at
infinity if the system was telecentric in the object space i.e.,
Y1=Yo). If the object distance is altered at any time, the value of
Y1 is adjusted to preserve the location of this implicit entrance
pupil. If an aperture stop is explicitly defined within the system
by use of an "ASTOP" command, the entry for Y1 is ignored since the
program automatically positions the paraxial chief ray so that it
passes through the center of the aperture stop. This command is

an alternative definition of object height when it is desired to
express the object by the angle which it subtends as seen from
surface 1. This object angle will be Uo degrees. Internally, the
program calculates Yo from Uo. This input value assumes a flat
object surface. Object coordinates for ray tracing, using the CMD
level command "FOB", are derived from Uo</span><span class=
"c3 c23">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and expressed as
fractions of Uo. Y1 is an optional input value. Y1 will be the
height at surface 1 of the paraxial chief ray in the YZ-plane.
Y1</span><span class="c3 c23">&nbsp;</span><span class=

specifying the semi-diameter of the system entrance pupil. If the
position of surface 1 is shifted by the program as a result of an
entrance pupil adjustment via the "ASTOP" command, the value of
"SAY" will be altered so that the object space slope angle of the
marginal ray is maintained at its original value. If the qualifier
word "FLOAT" is used and if there is a clear aperture assigned to
the aperture stop surface, then the "SAY" value will be continually
adjusted so that the YZ-plane marginal paraxial ray height at the
aperture stop surface will be kept equal to the YZ-plane dimension
of the clear aperture at the aperture stop surface. All clear
aperture decentrations and tilts will be ignored. "FLOAT" may not
be used if an f-number or exit pupil hold is in effect. If surface
#1 is at infinity, the accuracy of the "FLOAT" option may suffer.
In cases such as these, use the telecentric stop position option
instead of "floating" the "SAY" and "SAX" values. If "FLOAT" is in

<p class="c6"><span class="c0">SURFACE DEPENDENT
COMMANDS</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Surface dependent LENS
input and UPDATE LENS commands act on a specific surface of the
lens database. Each omitted command results in specific default
input for the specified database item. If no surface shape commands
are entered, the surface will be defined as plano (flat). If no
tilt or decentration commands are issued, the surface will not be
tilted or decentered. Only enough commands to define a surface
shape, location and special characteristics need be entered. In the
UPDATE LENS level, the order in which commands are issued for a
given surface is arbitrary. When in the LENS input level, the
program expects the last command for a particular surface to be a
command specifying the surface's optical material. The program
increments the surface counter automatically when this command is
issued. Commands such as "MYGLASS", "MODEL", "AIR", "REFL",
"REFLTIRO" or [a reference to a glass catalog glass] are optical
material commands. The image surface optical material is always
automatically renamed "LAST SURFACE". Dummy surfaces may be used at
any location in a lens database. Dummy surfaces are surfaces with
identical refractive indices on each side. For the surface shape
commands which follow, except where otherwise noted, a default
numeric entry will be interpreted as an input of 0.0. Lens surfaces
may be REAL or PARAXIAL and lenses may be "thick" or
"thin"</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">MODULAR LENS
ELEMENTS</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Several other programs
provide the user with a way of placing "lens modules" into an
optical system. The primary draw back of these implementations is
that there is no clear way to relate these "module" lenses to real
optical elements. In this program, lens modules are implemented via
an extension to the standard optical surface definitions normally
found in any optical design program. Through the use of the
following two commands "REAL" and "PARAX", any and all optical
surfaces can take on a paraxial "flat" profile while still
retaining their ability to bend real and paraxial rays by nature of
their curvature, conic constant and other surface shape
definitions. Thin paraxial lenses may be modeled by setting the
material thickness between paraxial surfaces to zero. All surface
solves and pikups remain in effect with these paraxial or modular
surfaces. When it is desired to convert these surfaces to "thick"
and "non-paraxial" surfaces, the element thicknesses are reset to
realistic values and the "REAL" command is issued to change the
surface type to a "real".</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c34"><span class="c0">REAL SURFACES</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- By default, all lens database surfaces in this program
are considered to be real surfaces. Real surfaces have as their
primary property some dependent longitudinal depth of curvature
(surface sag) which can vary with respect to some independent
lateral coordinate. This includes real plano-surfaces which have
0.0 surface sag for all lateral coordinate positions. By default
all surfaces are real surfaces.</span></p>

<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c34"><span class="c0">PARAXIAL
SURFACES</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Paraxial surfaces are lens
database surfaces which have no surface sag associated with them
even though they may have surface curvature or other surface shape
properties such as asphericity. A paraxial surface is designated as
such with the command "PARAX". Paraxial surfaces are of primary
interest during the initial layout of an optical system when that
layout process has progressed beyond the paraxial raytrace phase
but may not be ready for the "real" surface phase. When real
trigonometric rays are traced through paraxial surfaces, optical
path differences should be viewed with extreme caution.</span></p>

command altogether. Surfaces, by default, are always plano.
Remember, "c", the curvature, is just the reciprocal of the radius

Remember, "r", the radius of curvature, is just the reciprocal of

equivalent to "c" = 0.0. Plano surfaces ("c"=0.0) may not be
defined as conics since that definition has no meaning
mathematically. The conic constant of a plano surface is always
equal to 0.0. For low order aspheric deformations of plano

<p class="c6"><span class="c0">SURFACE TILT AND
DECENTRATION</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The terms "preceding
surface" and "following surface" refer to two adjacent surfaces in
the lens database. Tilt and decentration commands provide a means
of positioning a "following surface" relative to the local
coordinate system of its "preceding surface". In the absence of
tilts and decentrations, the X and Y-axis of a "following surface"
are assumed to be parallel to the X and Y-axis of its "preceding
surface". The local Z-axis of the surfaces are assumed to be
coincident. The origin of a following surface lies a distance "t"
from the origin of a "preceding surface" measured along the local
Z-axis of its "preceding surface". The local coordinate system of a
"preceding surface" is always the reference coordinate system for
its "following surface" after tilts and/or decentrations have been
applied. Tilts and decentrations are not applicable to the object
surface since the local coordinate system of the object
&nbsp;surface is the initial reference coordinate system for the
lens database. Tilts or decentrations assigned to the object
surface are always ignored during real ray tracing. The object
surface may either be surface zero or it may be some other surface
which has been temporarily assigned as the object surface using the
5th numeric word of the "FOB" command.</span></p>

commands define the current surface to be decentered with respect
to the local coordinate system of its "preceding surface" by the
amounts "yd" in the Y-direction, "xd" in the X-direction and "zd"
in the Z-direction. If these commands are issued followed only by a
"?", the current "yd", "xd" and/or "zd values will be displayed.
These commands are valid at both the LENS input and the UPDATE LENS
levels. The surface vertex of the surface containing these
decentrations will be located at coordinates X = "xd", Y = "yd" and
z = "zd"+"t" with respect to the coordinate system of the previous
surface. If the decentered surface is defined as a "TILT"ed surface
and if the associated surface angle rotations ALPHA, BETA and/or
GAMMA are non-zero, then these tilt rotations are performed</span>
<span class="c8">after</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;the

First, a negative GAMMA rotation is performed; then, a negative
BETA rotation is performed; and finally, a negative ALPHA rotation
is performed. After these reverse sequence rotations are performed,
negative "xd", negative "yd" and a negative "zd" decentrations are
made. These decentrations are made in the new coordinate system
generated by the rotations. The following three figures illustrate
the definitions of the surface angle rotations ALPHA, BETA and

only works on surfaces which have either a "TILT", "RTITLT" or
"TILT DAR" and also an explicit alternate pivot point defined on
them. By default, when the program starts or when a new lens
database is started, all surface tilts and decenters are understood
to be represented in the local coordinate system of the surface.
This system has its origin at the surface vertex. This is the
condition represented when the default "PIVAXIS VERTEX" is in
effect. If "PIVAXIS NORMAL" is set, then a different coordinate
system will be used as the tilt and decenter reference coordinate
system. This alternate coordinate system will have its origin on
the surface at locations X and Y where X and Y are the X and
Y-values of the PIVOT definition currently established at that
surface. The reference Z-axis will be parallel to the surface
normal at this point. If an unrealistic surface sag exists at this
surface at coordinates X and Y then the tilts and decenters will be
applied as if "PIVAXIS VERTEX" was in effect.</span></p>

<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">TILT , alpha , beta ,
gamma</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "TILT" command causes the
local coordinate system of the surface to be tilted by successive
surface angle rotations "alpha", "beta" and "gamma". If the surface
is decentered, decentrations are performed first. "alpha", "beta",
"gamma" are always expressed in degrees. This command is valid at
both the LENS input and the UPDATE LENS levels.</span></p>
<hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">RTILT , alpha , beta ,
gamma</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "RTILT" command (stands
for Reverse TILT) causes the local coordinate system of the surface
to be tilted by successive surface angle rotations negative
"gamma", negative "beta" and then negative "alpha". If the surface
is decentered, negative decentrations are performed after the
rotations. "gamma", "beta" and "alpha" are always expressed in
degrees. The command is the inverse of the "TILT" command. This
command is valid at both the LENS input and the UPDATE LENS
levels.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">TILT AUTO , alpha , beta ,
gamma</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "TILT AUTO" command
automatically tilts and decenters the surface to which it is
assigned so as to align the surface Z-axis parallel with the
so-called optical axis. The so-called optical axis is defined by a
real, non-paraxial reference ray traced from the center of the
object surface through the center of the reference surface. The
specific inputs of "alpha", "beta" and "gamma" are interpreted as
angular offsets to this automatic alignment process. A surface can
be held in an offset alignment mode with the optical axis using
explicit entries for "alpha", "beta" and "gamma". The default
values for "alpha", "beta" and "gamma" are 0.0. With the "TILT
AUTO" feature on, every time a reference ray is traced using the
"FOB" command, an on-axis reference ray is first traced at the
control wavelength, and then the surface with the "TILT AUTO"
assigned to it is decentered and tilted so as to remain aligned
with this on-axis reference ray. This command is valid at both the
LENS input and the UPDATE LENS levels. This auto-alignment will
effect the positions and orientations of all following
surfaces.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">TILT AUTOM , alpha , beta ,
gamma</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "TILT AUTOM" command is
identical to the "TILT AUTO" command, except that the surface
Z-axis is aligned anti-parallel to the optical axis. This command
is valid at both the LENS input and the UPDATE LENS
levels.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">TILT AUTOD</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "TILT AUTOD" command removes the automatic tilt
and decenter feature from the current surface. The surface will
remain tilted and decentered at its current position. This command
is valid at both the LENS input and the UPDATE LENS levels. "TILT
AUTO" and "TILT AUTOM" commands may only be used on surfaces which
follow the system reference surface. If the reference surface
position is redefined during ray tracing so that this rule is
violated, serious ray trace errors will occur.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">ABOUT TILT SIGN
CONVERTIONS</span><span class="c3">: When converting a lens system
from one which has ALPHA tilts to one which has BETA tilts, or vice
versa, remember that in order to maintain correct relationships, a
positive ALPHA tilt looks just like a negative BETA tilt a positive
BETA tilt looks just like a negative alpha tilt. Study the
foregoing figures before replacing BETA tilts with same sign ALPHA
tilts or ALPHA tilts with same sign BETA tilts. This is a very
common user error. &nbsp;(</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">TILTD , i , j</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "TILTD" command deletes any existing tilt
definitions from the current surface. Any PIKUPs referring to these
deleted tilt definitions will also be deleted. If "i" and "j" are
both explicitly entered, then the command acts on surfaces "i"
through "j", inclusively. The "lens pointer" is not modified by
this command. Decentrations are not deleted. &nbsp;This command is
valid at the UPDATE LENS level. Decentrations may be deleted using
the "YD , 0", &nbsp;"XD , 0" or &nbsp;"DEC , 0 , 0"
commands.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">TILT AUTOD , i ,
j</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "TILT AUTOD" command deletes
any existing TILT AUTO or TILT AUTOM definitions from the current
surface. If "i" and "j" are both explicitly entered, then the
command acts on surfaces "i" through "j", inclusively. The "lens
pointer" is not modified by this command. TILT AUTO will be
replaced by a simple TILT definition. This command is valid at the
UPDATE LENS level.</span></p>
<p class="c10 c39"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">SPECIAL TILT
COMMANDS</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The tilt and decenter commands already described are
all that are needed to completely describe surface positions and
orientations in the optical design and analysis process. The next
three commands are special tilt commands. They can be simulated
using the previously described tilt commands but at the expense of
using extra dummy surfaces containing tilts and
decenters.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">TILT BEN , alpha ,
beta</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - "TILT BEN" may not be placed
on the object surface or on surface #1. If you think you need it on
surface #1, make surface #1 a dummy surface and put it on surface
#2. The "TILT BEN" command is used to model a fold mirror with just
one lens database surface. Without the "TILT BEN" command, two
tilted surfaces would be required to model a fold mirror. The first
tilted surface would be required to model the mirror surface and
its tilt. The second "dummy" surface would be required to align the
new coordinate system with the optical axis. The "TILT BEN" command
causes the program to automatically and internally align the new
coordinate system with the optical axis without the use of this
second "dummy" surface. If decenters are assigned to a "TILT BEN"
surface, the decenters are performed before the tilts. The tilts
are performed in the order "alpha", then "beta" and then "gamma".
This command is valid at both the LENS input and the UPDATE LENS
levels. The program automatically computes a "gamma" rotation and
assigns it. This is only done once at the time the "TILT BEN"
command is issued. This automatically supplied "gamma" rotation
acts to rotate the system surface following the TILT BEN surface so
that the central ray will be aligned properly and so that a
meridional ray will remain a meridional ray in the surfaces
following the TILT BEN surface.</span></p>

<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3 c14">Issued with no numeric

<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">TILT BEND</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp; - The "TILT BEND" command is used to convert a "TILT
BEN" assignment on the current surface into a simple "TILT" on that
surface followed by a new surface with a "TILT" and appropriate
tilts and decenters such that the two surfaced work as the single
"TILT BEN" originally worked. All appropriate solves and
thicknesses are transferred to the new surface. Since "TILT BEND"
adds a lens surface, it is best to use "TILT BEND" from the highest
surface number to the lowest, when replacing multiple occurrences
of "TILT BEN" during the same lens modification session.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">TILT DAR , alpha , beta ,
gamma</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- "TILT DAR" may not be placed
on the object surface or on surface #1. If you think you need it on
surface #1, make surface #1 a dummy surface and put it on surface
#2. The "TILT DAR" command is used to model a tilted surface
without tilting the underlying coordinate system. Without the "TILT
DAR" command, two tilted surfaces would be required to model such a
geometry. The first tilted surface would be required to model the
surface and its tilt. A second "dummy" surface would be required
(with a reverse tilt assigned to it) to restore the original
coordinate system orientation. The "TILT DAR" command causes the
program to automatically and internally restore the original
coordinate system without the use of this second "dummy" surface.
If decenters are assigned to a "TILT DAR" surface, the decenters
are performed before the tilts. The tilts are performed in the
order "alpha", then "beta" and then "gamma". The tilts are then
removed from the underlying coordinate system in the order "gamma",
then "beta" and then "alpha". The decenters are then removed. This
command is valid at both the LENS input and the UPDATE LENS levels.
If the foregoing tilt commands are issued followed only by "?", the
current tilt definition type and associated angles will be
displayed. Issued with no numeric input, the "TILT DAR" command
converts any existing tilt type to a TILT DAR and leaves existing
alpha,beta and gamma values unchanged.</span></p>

the single "TILT DAR" originally worked. All appropriate solves and
thicknesses are transferred to the new surface. Since "TILT DARD"
adds a lens surface, it is best to use "TILT DARD" from the highest
surface number to the lowest, when replacing multiple occurrences
of "TILT DAR" during the same lens modification session.</span></p>

on the object surface or on surface #1. If you think you need it on
surface #1, make surface #1 a dummy surface and put it on surface
#2. The "TILT REV" command works exactly the same as an "RTILT"
command except that all rays intersect the surface to which the
"TILT REV" command is assigned, before the reverse tilts and
decentrations are applied. After ray intersection, "TILT REV"
causes the local coordinate system of the surface to which the
"TILT REV" is assigned, to be rotated by successive surface angle
rotations negative "gamma", negative "beta" and then negative
"alpha". If the surface is decentered, negative decentrations are
performed after the rotations. "gamma", "beta" and "alpha" are
always expressed in degrees. This command is valid at both the LENS
input and the UPDATE LENS levels. If the foregoing tilt commands
are issued followed only by "?", the current tilt definition type

default pivot point for all tilts is always the origin of the local
coordinate system on the surface. This alternate pivot point
definition is ignored by "TILT RET", "TILT AUTO", "TILT AUTOM" and
"TILT BEN" commands. The "pivx", "pivy" and "pivz" positions are
always measured in the local coordinate system of the surface upon
which the alternate pivot point assignment is placed. Any explicit
surface decentrations are added to the program computed decenters
needed to simulate a rotation about an alternate pivot

<p class="c6"><span class="c0">GLOBAL COORDINATE SURFACE
INPUT</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;-
&nbsp;In all of the previous and many following commands, surface
locations are specified in the local coordinate system of the
previous surface. This section describes a way to specify surface
locations in the coordinate system of a "global" surface. It should
be remembered that using the "TILT RET" command, the local surface
vertex of a surface could be automatically relocated and realigned
to the local coordinate system of a previous surface. The program
automatically computed and applied decentrations and tilts so as to
relocate and realign a surface vertex at this previous surface
location and orientation. The following six global coordinate
specification commands have been added to the program. They can be
applied to any surface which has previously been assigned a "TILT"
but are most useful when applied to a surface which has been
previously assigned a "TILT RET". After a "TILT RET" has returned
and oriented a surface to the "TILT RET" target surface
orientation, then the surface can be decentered and tilted with
respect to the RET surface local coordinate system. This provides
for full "global"-type of surface positioning. It allows the user
to have multiple "global"-type coordinate reference surfaces.
Remember that the "TILT RET" command is the command which defines
the active "global"-type of surface. The following six commands may
be used to define this type of "global" surface
positioning:</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">GDX , gdx</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c34"><span class="c8 c18">GDY , gdy</span><span class=

<p class="c34"><span class="c8 c18">GDZ , gdz</span><span class=

gbeta</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c34"><span class="c8 c18">GGAMMA ,
ggamma</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3 c14">The angles are input in
degrees. These six global positioning data items can now also be
"picked up", used as optimization or tolerancing variables, gotten
using the "GET" command and used as optimization or tolerancing
operands.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">SINGLE SURFACE
PIKUPS</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Single surface PIKUP commands
are tools used to link a surface parameter (radius, thickness,
glass, etc.) of one surface to a corresponding surface parameter of
another surface. These PIKUPs are resolved ( i.e., values are
actually assigned) each time the LENS input or UPDATE LENS levels
are exited using the "EOS" or "END" command. Checking is performed
to determine if PIKUP and/or solve conflicts exist. Error messages
are automatically displayed if disallowed combinations of PIKUPs
and solves are attempted. The usual error is an attempt to pick up
a surface parameter from a following surface when the picked-up
parameter is defined indirectly in terms of other PIKUPs or solves.
These nested PIKUPs are not allowed. The general form of the
"PIKUP" command is:</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">PIKUP (parameter name) , j , a ,
b ,, cfflag</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The PIKUP surface
parameter value "P" (the eventual value after "EOS" or "END") is
related to the corresponding parameter value "P(j)" at surface "j"
by the relation:</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 90.60px; height: 26.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3 c14">"a" is the user-supplied
multiplicative constant and "b" user-supplied is the additive
constant. PIKUPs are alway kept properly "up to date", even during
tolerancing and optimization. The "cfflag" is normally left blank.
If "cfflag" is left blank, then the source value for the pikup will
be data from the current lens configuration. If "cfflag" is not
left blank, then the source value for the pikup will be data from
lens configuration #1, otherwise known as the main configuration.
Some PIKUP parameters logically do not use the multiplicative and
additive constants. The following table is a list of all 44
parameters that may be picked up:</span></p>

"COBS", "GLASS", if no entry is made for the multiplicative
constant "a", the program assumes a=1.0. If no entry is made for
the additive constant "b", it is assumed to be 0.0. The default for
"cfflag" is blank. A negative value for the surface number entry
"j" may be used to count back from the current surface. Thus,
&nbsp;j = -1 denotes the immediately preceding surface. The "PIKUP
CVTOR" and "PIKUP RDTOR" commands require both the current surface
and the referenced surface "j" to be defined as toric and as the
same type of toric (either both Y-TORIC or both X-TORIC) by the
time the "EOS" or "END" command is issued. The "PIKUP PRO" and
"PIKUP NPRO" commands require both the current surface and the
referenced surface "j" to be defined as either the same type of
toric or non-toric by the time the "EOS" or "END" command is
issued. If these conditions do not exist at the time the "EOS" or
"END" command is issued, the "pikup" surface will be redefined so
as to be either non-toric or to be the same toric type as the
surface being referenced by the PIKUP. The picking up of an
aspheric coefficient automatically identifies the "pikup" surface
as aspheric. Any undefined coefficients are assumed equal to
zero.</span></p>

UPDATE LENS level commands. After this initial calculation of "b",
the surface PIKUP will be reset to a normal PIKUP. This special
PIKUP option is an easy way of establishing linear relationships

<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">PIKUP THOAL , j , k , a , b ,
cfflag</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "PIKUP THOAL" command is
a multiple-surface thickness pikup. It is used to link the
thickness on the current surface to the overall length (sum of
axial surface thicknesses) from surface "j" to surface "k". The
current surface is not allowed to lie in the surface number range
"j" to "k". The "PIKUP THOAL" is resolved ( i.e., value is actually
assigned) each time the LENS input or UPDATE LENS levels are exited
using the "EOS" or "END" command. Checking is performed to
determine if PIKUP and/or solve conflicts exist. Error messages are
automatically displayed if disallowed combinations of PIKUP THOAL,
PIKUP TH and solves are attempted. The usual error is an attempt to
pick up from a following surface when the picked-up parameter is
defined indirectly in terms of other PIKUPs or solves. As before,
nested PIKUPs are not allowed.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c3">The PIKUP'd up surface thickness
value (the eventual surface thickness value after "EOS" or "END")
is set equal to the sum of the axial thicknesses from surface "j"
to surface "k" multiplied by the multiplicative constant "a" and
then increased by the additive constant "b". "a" is the
user-supplied multiplicative constant and "b" is the user-supplied
additive constant. The defaults for "a" and "b" are 1.0 and 0.0,
respectively. PIKUPs are alway kept properly "up to date", even
during tolerancing and optimization. The "cfflag" is normally left
blank. If "cfflag" is left blank, then the source value for the
pikup will be data from the current lens configuration. If "cfflag"
is not left blank, then the source value for the pikup will be data
from lens configuration #1, otherwise known as the main
configuration. Unlike the single surface pikup commands, there
is</span> <span class="c8">no</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;special
pickup option available for use with the "PIKUP THAOL" command. All
PIKUPs take precedence over optimization and tolerance variable
definitions. If there is a conflict, the variable definition is
disallowed or deleted.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">PIKUP DELETIONS</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">PIKD (optional parameter name) ,
i , j</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "PIKD" command, issued
with no optional pikup parameter name, deletes all existing PIKUP
definitions from the designated current or designated surface. If
an optional pikup parameter name from the list of pikup types is
entered, then only that PIKUP is deleted. "PIKD" deletes all PIKUPs
from a surface whereas "PIKD RD" deletes the radius PIKUP if one
exists. If "i" and "j" are both explicitly entered, then the
command acts on surfaces "i" through "j", inclusively. This command
is valid at the UPDATE LENS level.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">CMD LEVEL LINKING</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "LINK" command provides a way of assigning PIKUPS
from the CMD level. It is a shortcut method and produces exactly
the same result as if the UPDATE LENS level was entered and a
traditional PIKUP was assigned. The "LINK" command syntax
is:</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LINK (parameter name) , i , j ,
a , b</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - "i" is the target surface
number to which the PIKUP is assigned. "j" is the source surface
number from which the PIKUP receives its reference data. "a" and
"b" are the multiplicative and additive constants. The "cfflag"
parameter of the "PIKUP" command is not supported in the "LINK"
command.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LINKD (parameter name) , i ,
j</span><span class="c3">The "LINKD" command, issued with no
optional pikup parameter name, deletes all existing PIKUP
definitions from surface "i". It is the CMD level equivalent of the
UPDATE LENS command "PIKD". If an optional pikup parameter name
from the list of pikup types is entered, then only that PIKUP is
deleted. "LINKD" deletes all PIKUPs from a surface whereas "LINKD
RD" deletes the radius PIKUP if one exists. If "i" and "j" are both
explicitly entered, then the command acts on surfaces "i" through
"j", inclusively. The "TLINK command provides a way of assigning
one time LINK</span> <span class="c8">without
PIKUPS</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;from the CMD level. It is
exactly the same as issuing a "LINK" &nbsp;command followed
immediately by a "LINKD" command.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">TLINK (parameter name) , i , j ,
a , b</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - "i" is the target surface
number upon which the "TLINK" operates. "j" is the source surface
number from which the one time link receives its reference data.
"a" and "b" are the multiplicative and additive
constants.</span></p>

normal vector is taken as the</span> <span class=

above definition of surface normals is</span> <span class=

<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">BEAM FOOTPRINT
CONTROLS</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - In some very special cases
during the generation of beam footprint plotting (see the GRAPHICS
section of this manual) it may be desired that the "APE" qualifier
word of the "FOOT" command not be used but at the same time it is
still desired that surfaces additional to the reference surface be
used to control the shape of the beam. In these very special cases,
the surfaces which are to be used to control beam shape can be set
as foot print blocking surfaces with the LENS INPUT and LENS UPDATE
command "FOOTBLOK". There are two different "FOOTBLOK" surface
settings available in the program, "YES"/"ON" and "NO"/"OFF". The
default setting is "NO"/"OFF".</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3 c14">"FOOTBLOK" was originally
only supposed to work in beam footprint ray tracing. It became
necessary to be able to selectively shut "off" regular ray aperture
and obscuration checking during normal ray tracing when "RAY CAOB"
was either issued by the user or by some internal program
operation. So now, if "FOOTBLOK" is set to "ON" on a surface and
"RAY CAOB" is issued, no aperture or obscuration checking will be
done at that surface. This is a case of a double positive equaling
a negatuve.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">FOOTBLOK ("YES/ON"</span>
<span class="c5">or</span><span class=
"c8 c18">&nbsp;"NO/OFF")</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - The
"FOOTBLOK" command establishes the nature of the footprint blocking
status of a surface. The footprint blocking setting should only be
set to "YES"/"ON" when it is desired to shape a beam with clear
apertures and obscuration on surfaces additional to the reference
surface and then to show that the shaped beam walks off the surface
at which the beam foot print is plotted.</span></p>

used to enter the specific gravity, in grams/cc, of the lens
material at the current surface. The default value for the specific

POINTS</span><span class="c3 c49">&nbsp;</span><span class=
"c3 c14">- The</span> <span class="c3">intersection points of a ray
with a surface are distinguished by the fact that at one
intersection point, the angle of incidence (angle between ray
vector and surface normal vector) is always less than 90 degrees in
magnitude, and at the other, the angle is always greater than 90
degrees. The intersection point at which the angle of incidence is
less than 90 degrees in magnitude will be called the "first
intersection" point. &nbsp;The intersection point at which the
angle of incidence is greater than 90 degrees in magnitude will be
called the "second &nbsp;intersection" point.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">SELECTION OF INTERSECTION POINTS AND
"RAY TRAVEL DIRECTION"</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- he direction
of travel of the ray in the local coordinate system determines the
standard intersection point. If the ray is traveling in a media
which has a positive refractive index, the ray is considered to be
traveling in the "positive" direction. If the ray is traveling in a
media which has a negative refractive index, the ray direction is
considered to be traveling in the "negative" direction.</span></p>

zero height target is defined to be located at the surface vertex
if the surface has no clear aperture assigned, and it is located at
the center of the clear aperture if a clear aperture is assigned.
Decentering and tilting a clear aperture causes the chief ray
aiming point to move with respect to the surface vertex. The real
trigonometric raytrace considers all parameters in the lens
database, the alternate configuration database and the special
surface database. The aperture stop and the reference surface may
be defined on the same surface or on different surfaces as suits
the needs of the designer.</span> <span class="c8">In most cases,
they should be placed on the same surface.</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;The height of the paraxial chief ray at surface 1,
adjusted by any tilts and decentration on surface 1, is used as the
first aiming point in the iterative, real chief ray aiming
process.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">ASTOP
(qualifier)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;The "ASTOP" command
defines the surface to which it is applied to be the aperture stop
for the lens system. The "qualifier word" is used to designate
whether or not paraxial entrance and paraxial exit pupil position
adjustments are to be performed. If the "ASTOP" command is issued
followed only by a "?", the current aperture stop surface number
and adjustment conditions will be displayed. This command is valid
at both the LENS input and the UPDATE LENS levels. When a paraxial
entrance pupil position adjustment is made (qualifier word EN or
ENEX), the axial thicknesses of the object surface and surface
number 1 are adjusted such that the overall length from the object
surface to surface number 2 remains unchanged while, at the same
time, surface number 1 is relocated to the position of the system
paraxial entrance pupil. When a paraxial exit pupil position
adjustment is made (qualifier word EX or ENEX), the axial
thicknesses of the (image surface number - 1) surface and the
(image surface number -2) surface are adjusted so that the overall
length from the (image surface number - 2) surface to the image
surface remains unchanged while, at the same time, the (image
surface number -1) surface is relocated to the position of the
system paraxial exit pupil.</span></p>

<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">INR , inr</span><span class=

radius (semi-diameter) value to a surface. This value will be used
whenever special surface TYPE 9 or TYPE 10 Zernike polynomial phase
surface data is assigned to the surface at the SPSRF or UPDATE
SPSRF program level. The "inr" value is used to provide
normalization to a unit radius for the Zernike polynomials. If the
"INR" command is issued followed only by a "?", the current "inr"
value will be displayed. This command is valid at both the LENS
input and the UPDATE LENS levels. If no explicit "inr" value is
assigned, then the default "inr" value will be:</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c11 c3 c14">1. The sum of the absolute
values of the x-clear aperture value and the x-clear aperture
offset or the sum of the absolute values of the y-clear aperture

explicitly entered, then the command acts on surfaces "i" through
"j", inclusively. The "lens pointer" is not modified by this
command. This command is valid at the UPDATE LENS level.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">DUMMY SURFACES</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp; - A dummy surface is usually defined as a surface which
has the same optical material in front of it and behind it. In some
cases, plotted rays will not be shown going to and from dummy
surfaces if the rays are "virtual". Virtual rays are defined in the
GRAPHICS section of this manual. Virtual rays can be turned "on"
(see GRAPHICS) but then all virtual rays are shown and that can get
messy. A virtual ray will be drawn to and from a dummy surface if
an explicit clear aperture has been assigned to that dummy surface.
If a virtual ray needs to be drawn to and from a dummy surface and
a clear aperture can not be assigned to that dummy surface due to
other design or analysis considerations, the surface may be
"forced" to not be considered a dummy surface by using the
following command:</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">NODUM ("YES/ON"</span>
<span class="c5">or</span><span class=
"c8 c18">&nbsp;"NO/OFF")</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - The
"NODUM" command establishes a surface as "not a dummy" if the
qualifier words "YES" or "ON" are used with it. The qualifier words
"NO" or "OFF" are used to cancel a NODUM YES or NODUM ON
assignment. The "NODUM" status is remembered in the lens database
and may be displayed using the "DUMOUT" command .</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">OPTICAL MATERIALS
COMMANDS</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">AIR</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "AIR" command specifies that the material
following the current surface will be AIR having a refractive index
of 1.0. At the LENS input level, this command also advances the
surface counter by "1". Any surface dependent input following an
"AIR" command will be associated with the next surface. Entry of
multiple "AIR" commands at the LENS input level causes multiple
plano "dummy" surfaces to be entered. This command is valid at both
the LENS input and the UPDATE LENS levels. "AIR" may also be
entered as "GLASS AIR".</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">REFL</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "REFL" command specifies that the current surface
is a mirror surface. The refractive indices of the material
following this surface will be of the same magnitude but opposite
in sign to the refractive indices of the material preceding it. At
the LENS input level, this command also advances the surface
counter by "1". Any surface dependent input following an "REFL"
command will be associated with the next surface. Entry of multiple
"REFL" commands at the LENS input level causes multiple plano
mirror surfaces to be entered. This command is valid at both the
LENS input and the UPDATE LENS levels. "REFL" may also be entered
as "GLASS REFL".</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">REFLTIRO</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "REFLTIRO" command specifies that the current
surface is a mirror surface if and only if a total internal
reflection condition exists for the current ray. The refractive
index of the material into which the ray would refract, should TIR
not exist, is always assumed to be 1.0. If TIR can not occur for a
ray, then the ray fails. At the LENS input level, this command also
advances the surface counter by "1". Any surface dependent input
following an "REFLTIRO" command will be associated with the next
surface. Entry of multiple "REFLTIRO" commands at the LENS input
level causes multiple plano mirror surfaces to be entered. This
command is valid at both the LENS input and the UPDATE LENS levels.
"REFLTIRO" may also be entered as "GLASS REFLTIRO".</span></p>
<hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">MYGLASS (glass name) , n1 , n2 ,
n3 , n4 , n5</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "MYGLASS" command
specifies that the material following the current surface will be
made of material "glass name". The refractive indices of this
material will be "n1", "n2", "n3", "n4" and "n5" corresponding to
the first five program wavelengths. If any of these five numeric
values is missing, that refractive index will be set to 1.0. At the
LENS input level, this command also advances the surface counter by
"1". Any surface dependent input following a "MODEL" command will
be associated with the next surface. Entry of multiple glass input
commands at the LENS input level causes multiple plano surfaces to
be entered. Each of those surfaces will have material type "glass
name" in the space following it. When the "MYGLASS" command is used
to specify the material type at a particular surface, no refractive
index interpolation is performed for that surface if wavelength
values are changed!</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">N1 , n</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;through</span> <span class="c8 c18">N10 ,
n</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- At the UPDATE LENS level, the "N1"
through "N10" commands specify that if the current surface material
was defined using the "MYGLASS" command, then the refractive index
for wavelengths 1, to 10 will be set to the specified value. At the
LENS INPUT level, the "N1" through "N10" commands specify that if
the previous surface material was defined using the "MYGLASS"
command, then the refractive index for wavelengths 1, to 10 will be
set to the specified value. A surface's material type must be
explicitly defined by a "MYGLASS" command before the refractive
indices may be changed using the "N1" through "N10"
commands.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">(Catalog Name) &nbsp;(Glass Name
or Glass Number)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - This command
specifies that the material following the current surface will be
made of material "Glass Name" whose refractive index wavelength
interpolation coefficients are stored in the glass catalog and is
named "Catalog Name". Refractive indices will be calculated for
each wavelength. The program will determine if these indices are to
have positive or negative signs depending on the presence of
mirrors on other lens surfaces. At the LENS input level, this
command also advances the surface counter by "1". Any surface
dependent input following this command will be associated with the
next surface. Entry of multiple commands of this form at the LENS
input level causes multiple plano surfaces to be entered. Each of
those surfaces will have material type "Glass Catalog" "Glass Name"
in the space following it. This command is valid at both the LENS
input and the UPDATE LENS levels. This command is the only
exception to the rule that a qualifier word may only have eight
alphanumeric characters. "Glass Name" can have up to 13
alphanumeric characters since some catalog glasses have 13
character glass names. If, during optimization, refractive indices
are varied as part of the optimization process, glasses defined
with this command will be permanently converted to glasses defined
by the "MYGLASS" command. Only surfaces whose refractive indices
are defined with the "MYGLASS" command may have their refractive
indices varied during optimization. The following table lists valid
glass catalog names, types of material stored and wavelength
regions:</span></p>

<p class="c6"><span class="c0">USER-DEFINED GLASS
CATALOG</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The user-defined glass
catalog, which is referenced by catalog name "USER", is stored in
the ASCII file "USER.DAT". It is stored in the same directory into
which the main program was installed and from which the main
program runs. It is an ASCII file whose entries are free format and
are expected to be of the form:</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">GLASS_NAME , A0 , A1 , A2 , A3 ,
A4 , A5</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; "GLASS NAME" is a one to
thirteen character, user-defined glass name, and A0 through A5 are
the six interpolation coefficients used with the following
equation:</span></p>
<p class="c10"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c3">All input in the file USER.DAT
should be separated by spaces or commas. If the user only has a
table of index versus wavelength, then SPFIT routines (see the
SPFIT section of this manual) may be used to determine the
coefficients. A sample "USER.DAT" exists in the main program
directory. &nbsp;</span><span class="c13">λ</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;is always assumed to be represented in microns. An
example of fitting index data and automatic assigning the fitting
coefficients to a new user-defined glass type is given in the SPFIT
section of the manual.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">MODEL GLASSES</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- Refractive index values may always be varied during
optimization when a surface's glass type is specified with the
"MYGLASS" command. When this is done, it is the responsibility of
the designer to build constraints into the merit function which
keep the glass from becoming an unrealistic material. This makes
for maximum program flexibility but requires much from the
designer. The "MODEL" command makes the process of varying glasses
during optimization a much simpler.</span></p>

, Vd ,</span> <span class="c9">Δ</span><span class="c8 c18">Partial
Dispersion</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - The "MODEL" command is
used to specify a glass in terms of its refractive index at the
Fraunhoffer "d" line (0.5875618 micron) and its Abbe-number Vd.
After the user specifies these two values, the program
automatically determines the refractive index values at all other
wavelengths by assuming that the glass is on the "normal" partial
dispersion line defined by the two Schott glasses K7 and F2. If the
user wishes to have this glass shifted "off" the "normal"
dispersion line, then a partial dispersion shift value should be
entered as the third numeric word. The partial dispersion shift is
assumed to be constant across the entire wavelength band in the
lens database. The "Nd" , "Vd" and &nbsp;"</span><span class=
"c13">Δ</span><span class="c3">Partial Dispersion" (also called
"DPART") can be used as optimization and tolerance variables. They
are also included in the "GET" list and the lists of pre-defined
operands.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">INDEX , nd</span><span class=

using the "MODEL" command.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">VNUM , Vd</span><span class=

the "MODEL" command.</span></p>

<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">DPARTL ,</span> <span class=
"c9">Δ</span><span class="c8 c18">Partial

<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">FINDING REAL
GLASSES</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- After optimization, it is
usually necessary to replace the "MODEL" glass with a real glass.
This is done with the help of the following CMD level
command:</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">FINDGLASS (catalog name</span>
<span class="c5">or</span><span class="c8 c18">&nbsp;ALL) , i ,
n</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - The "FINDGLASS" command, issued
at the CMD program level, searches the SCHOTT, SCH2000, OHARA,
HOYA, CHANCE PILKINGTON, CORNING FRANCE, and/or HIKARI glass
catalogs for the closest "n" glasses to the MODEL glass on surface
"i" and displays them. The valid qualifier words are: "SCHOTT",
"SCH2000", "HOYA", "OHARA", "CORNIN", "CHANCE", "HIKARI" or "ALL"
(to search all the catalogs).</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">TOMODEL i</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp; - The "TOMODEL" command converts any glass in the
SCHOTT, "SCH2000", OHARA, HOYA, CHANCE PILKINGTON, CORNING FRANCE,
HIKARI, RUSSIAN and RADHARD glass catalogs into a MODEL glass with
the correct values of</span> <span class="c3 c14">Nd , Vd ,</span>

<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">COATING , n</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "COATING" command specifies that the surface
coating data designated by coating file number "n" will be
associated with the current surface. This command is valid at both
the LENS input and the UPDATE LENS levels. Surface coating data is
stored in the files COAT0001.DAT THROUGH COAT1000.DAT (file numbers
1 to 1000) which are ASCII files stored in the main program
directory. &nbsp;The default coating is an uncoated surface with no
losses.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">SURFACE COATING
DATABASE</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The SURFACE COATING
database consists of user-generated ASCII files COAT0001.DAT
through COAT1000.DAT. These files hold the complete description of
all the types of single and multi-layer coatings available for use
in the program. Up to 1000 individual coating files may be defined
and redefined by the user.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">NATURE OF THE COATING
DESCRIPTIONS</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Unlike most other
optical design and analysis codes, the program contains a flexible
syntax for describing optical surface coatings in many different
ways. Each coating definition consists of a series data lines in an
ASCII file which describe the type of coating and its
characteristics. All coatings are prepared ahead of time by the
user using any text editor. The syntax of every coating definition
file begins with the header line which contains a single integer
that specifies the coating type. &nbsp;The program currently has 4
coating types availabe. Any of these 4 coating types may be used in
any of the 1000 different coating database files.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">COATING TYPES</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- Valid coating types are defined below. Coatings are
used for energy throughput calculations when surface coating
dependent ray trace options are in are in effect. When performing
polarization type calculations, only type 1 (no effect on
ploarization) or type 4 coatings will be used.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c30 c49 c51">COATING TYPE

Transmissions and reflections are 100% efficient. This is the

can only be assigned to the surface immediately in front of the
final surface of the lens. This PERFECT lens will have a focal
length equal to the thickness assigned to it by either the "TH" or

<p class="c34 c26"><span class="c0">DIFFRACTION
GRATINGS</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Linear diffraction gratings
may be placed on plano, spherical, conic, aspheric and anamorphic
aspheric surfaces. The grating lines are formed by the intersection
of a set of evenly spaced "generating planes" with the current
optical surface. These grating surfaces may also be defined as
Type-12 HOE special surfaces and in doing so, compound interlaced
gratings may be modeled. During lens scaling, none of the grating
parameters are scaled. Diffraction gratings are implemented using
the following diffraction grating definition commands:</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">GRT</span> <span class=

<p class="c34 c26"><span class="c8 c18">GRO ,
order</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "GRO" command is used to
specify or change the order of the diffration grating. A positive
order will deflect the ray in the positive X, Y and/or Z direction.

= 0.0)</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c34 c26"><span class="c8 c18">GRS ,
spacing</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "GRS" command is used to
specify or change line spacing (in lens units) of the diffration
grating. (Default value = 0.0)</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c34 c26"><span class="c8 c18">GRX , x-grating direction
number</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "GRX" command is used to
specify or change the x-direction number of the grating generating
planes. (Default value = 0.0)</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c34 c26"><span class="c8 c18">GRY , y-grating direction
number</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "GRY" command is used to
specify or change the y-direction number of the grating generating
planes. (Default value = 1.0 if the space ahead of the grating has
positive refractive indecies and = -1.0 if the space ahead of the
grating has negative refractive indecies.)</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c34 c26"><span class="c8 c18">GRZ , z-grating direction
number</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "GRZ" command is used to
specify or change the z-direction number of the grating generating
planes. (Default value = 0.0)</span></p>
<p class="c20 c26"></p>
<p class="c6 c26"><span class="c3">The linear diffraction grating
special surface may be assigned to any plano, spherical, toroidal,
conic, aspheric or anamorphic surface and this surface may also
have Special Surface definitions assigned to it. The grating can be
thought of as being generated by the intersection, with the
surface, of a series of parallel planes. The x, y and z-grating
direction numbers are used to specify the orientation of the normal
to these planes in the local coordinate system of the surface.
There are two sets of direction numbers which can be used to
specify the orientation of an infinite plane in space (two
anti-parallel normal vectors). The choice of one of these normal
vectors over the other has the effect of changing the definition of
the diffraction orders from the U. S. standard definition to the
European standard definition.</span></p>

the grating has positive refractive indices. If the previous space
has negative refractive indices, the signs of the grating direction
numbers will need to be reversed or the action of the specified
diffraction order will be incorrect.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">GRATING
EFFICIENCY</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The efficiency of a ruled
diffraction grating is automatically computed when ever the
"COATINGS" command is set to "COATINGS ON". In this case, the
energy in each ray traced is reduced by the efficiency computed
with the following equation:</span></p>
<p class="c10"><img></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c3">where:</span> <span class=
"c13">λ</span><span class="c3 c42">B</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;is the blaze wavelength (the program uses the current
control wavelength for the blaze wavelength),</span> <span class=
"c13">λ</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is the wavelength for the
current ray being traced, A is the grating line spacing in microns,
m is the grating order and is assumed to be the order for which the
grating is blazed.</span> <span class="c13">θ</span><span class=
"c3 c42">o</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is the angle of incidence
for the ray at the grating. This calculation is not meant to
replace full diffraction efficiency codes but is meant to give the
user a way of estimating system through put in systems with
diffraction gratings. This relationship has been computationally
verified for metalized, ruled gratings.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">CLEAR APERTURE AND OBSCURATION
COMMANDS</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Clear apertures and
obscurations are used to define limits to the extent of an optical
surface, generally in directions perpendicular to the local Z-axis
at each surface. They play an important role in limiting ray
bundles in spot diagrams and in defining diffracting apertures in
diffraction-based calculations. Circular, rectangular, elliptical
and racetrack shapes may be used in defining these surface limits.
All clear aperture and obscuration definitions are centered on the
local coordinate systems of their respective surfaces unless
explicit aperture/obscuration decentrations and tilts are
specified. Besides the commands which allow for explicit clear
aperture assignment, there is also an option descibed in the CMD
section of this manual which provides for automatic assignment of
circular clear apertures based upon limiting ray data. See the
command "SETCLAP" in the CMD section for more details.</span></p>

assigned and if the surface is concave toward air and if an
explicit value for the optional "radius to flat" has been entered
and if that "radius to flat" value is less than the "ca" value,
then the surface will be drawn with a flattened area on it in all
graphical representations of the surface. If "</span><span class=
"c13">Δ</span><span class="c3">z" has been entered along with the
"radius to flat" value, then the flattened area will be drawn with
its maximum diameter z-position retarded or advanced by the
amount</span> <span class="c13">Δ</span><span class="c3">z.
The</span> <span class="c13">Δ</span><span class="c3">z value is

"cay" and the X-semi-axis dimension is to be "cax". It is to be
centered at Yd and Xd. All four values are specified in lens units

The "CLAP POLY" command specifies that a regular polygon clear
aperture is to be assigned to the current surface. The "R" is the
distance from the polygon center out to any corner. "n" specifies
the number of sides and can be set to from 3 to 200. It is to be
centered at Yd and Xd.All "R", "Yd" and "Xd" are specified in lens
units. This command is valid at both the LENS input and the UPDATE

the clear aperture (CONFORMAL). If "CONFORMAL" is set, the
polygonal clear aperture will lie "in the surface" rather than in
the surface tangent plane at the surface vertex. If the polygonal
clear aperture is not decentered or if there are no multiple clear

aberration data will be displayed in transverse linear measure in
these modes. First, third and fifth order aberrations and primary

paraxial based aberrations will not be converted to transverse
linear measure (i.e., they remain the direct sum of surface
contribution coefficients).</span></p>

real ray aberration data will be displayed in angular measure in
these modes. The angular measure is either "radians", "degrees" or
"tangent" depending on the program angular mode setting. First,
third and fifth order aberrations and primary and secondary
chromatic differences will be displayed in angular radian measure.
If the qualifier "UAFOCAL" is specified, these paraxial based
aberrations will not be converted to transverse linear measure
(i.e., they remain the direct sum of surface contribution
coefficients). If the "MODE" command is issued followed only by a
"?", the current mode name will be displayed. The default mode is
"FOCAL" when a new lens is created. The default program angular
mode for ray data display is degrees.</span></p>

section allow changing and interrogation of this angular mode.
Unlike this program, some optical design programs do not support an
AFOCAL mode and require the use of a "PERFECT" lens construct to
make an afocal system appear as a focal system. If users
transitioning from one of these other design codes wish to use a
"PERFECT" lens construct rather than design in the native AFOCAL
modes of this program, they may do so via use of the "PERFECT"
command described later in this section of the manual.</span></p>

PUPIL ADJUSTMENT</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The next three
commands are issued from the CMD level only. They adjust
thicknesses and paraxial ray heights in order to produce specified
lens system magnifications, f-numbers and exit pupil
semi-diameters. These requested adjustments are stored with the
lens database.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>

COMMANDS</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">MAGY , M , i ,
j</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "MAGY" command is used to
adjust the transverse, YZ-plane, paraxial, finite conjugate
magnification "M" between surfaces "i" and "j" to the specified
value "m". The object and the image surfaces are the default values
for "i" and "j", respectively. The actual adjustment is made by
alteration of the axial thickness of surfaces "i" and "j-1".
Positive magnifications are interpreted as "real" imagery and
negative magnifications are interpreted as "virtual" imagery. The
magnification is defined by the following equation:</span></p>

surfaces "i" through "j". If there are, a warning message will be
issued and no adjustment will be performed. The reference object
heights should be set using "SCY" and/or "SCX" before the
adjustment is performed.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">MAGX , M , i ,
j</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "MAGX" command is identical to
the "MAGY" command, except that it works in the XZ-plane using
XZ-plane paraxial ray data. The "MAGY" and "MAGX" commands are
mutually exclusive since there is only one pair of thicknesses
available to use to perform the magnification
adjustment.</span></p>

<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c34"><span class="c8 c18">FNBY (HLD or DEL) ,
f-number</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "FNBY" command, used
with no qualifier input, is used to adjust the paraxial axial ray
slope in the YZ-plane to produce the "f-number" specified. This
adjustment is performed by a change in the paraxial axial ray
height at surface 1 with all solves temporarily
suspended.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class=
"c3">This adjusted paraxial axial ray is traced, and each paraxial
ray solve datum is reset to the value computed for it during this
paraxial ray trace. The "f-number" is changed without altering any
thicknesses or curvatures. The lens MODE must be FOCAL or UFOCAL,
and the paraxial axial ray at the image surface cannot have a zero
slope. A zero slope would imply an afocal system where the
"f-number" is not defined. If the qualifier "HLD" is used, the
command performs the same functions described above. In addition, a
code is set in the lens database which specifies that the
"f-number" is to be held at the input value even when manual or
automatic changes are made to the lens prescription The use of the
"DEL" qualifier word causes any existing "FNBY HLD" conditions in
the lens database to be removed.</span></p>

<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">ERY and ERX &nbsp;(HLD or DEL) ,

and "ERX" commands are used to adjust the radius of the exit pupil
in the YZ and the XZ-planes to radius "exit pupil semi-diameter".
This adjustment is performed by a change in the paraxial axial ray
height at surface 1 with all solves temporarily suspended. This
adjusted paraxial axial ray is traced, and each paraxial ray solve
datum is reset to the value computed for it during this paraxial
ray trace. The "exit pupil semi-diameter" is changed without
altering any thicknesses or curvatures. The lens MODE must be
AFOCAL or UAFOCAL, and the paraxial axial ray at the image surface
must have a zero slope. The "HLD" qualifier word causes a code to
be set in the lens database which specifies that the "exit pupil
radius" is to be held at the input value even when manual or
automatic changes are made to the lens prescription. The " DEL"
qualifier word causes any existing "HLD" conditions in the lens
database to be removed The "ERX", command is identical to the "ERY"
command, except that it acts in the XZ-plane using XZ-plane
paraxial ray trace data. Exit pupil semi-diameter holds may not be
used if the "say" or "sax" values are "floating".</span></p>

"c3">&nbsp;The "AIMRAY (ON or YES)" and "AIMRAY (OFF or NO)"
commands either activate or deactivate real ray, ray aiming to a
specific relative coordinate in the reference surface. When ray
aiming is "(OFF or NO)", rays are aimed at next surface after the
object surface based only upon the existing paraxial ray trace. It
should only be used for diagnosing ray tracing problems. Issued
with a "?", the "AIMRAY" command returns a message as to the
current setting. This command is "sticky" and remains as set for
the current lens until changed by the user. The setting is stored
with the current lens in the lens database. The "AIMRAY" command is
also described in the "CMD" section.</span></p>

"c5">or</span><span class="c8 c18">&nbsp;NO)</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;If "TEL ON" is set, then the user must set or must have
set the aperture of the system using the "NAOY" and "NAOX"
commands. "NAOX" is only needed, if the "noax" value is to be
different from the "naoy" value. Whenever "NAOY" is issued, it
resets both the "noay" and "naox" values. If this is not done, the
ray trace will give strange and incorrect results.
&nbsp;Alternatively, the "FNOY" and "FNOX" commands can be used to
specify the numerical apertures in terms of object space F-numbers.
The "TEL (ON or YES)" and "TEL (OFF or NO)" commands either
activate or deactivate real and paraxial ray, telecentric ray
aiming. When telecentric ray aiming is "(OFF or NO)", real and
paraxial rays are aimed as usual depending upon the location of the
reference surface, the aperture stop surface and the current
"AIMRAY" setting. When telecentric ray aiming is "(ON or YES)", all
chief rays from all object points are aimed so that they are all
parallel to the "gut" or central chief ray and to each other and so
that they are all perpendicular to surface 0. In this setting,
paraxial chief rays will not be aimed at the aperture stop surface
and real chief rays will not be aimed toward the reference surface.
All non-chief rays will be aimed toward the surface 1 using either
the current SAY or SAX values. This telecentric ray aiming will
ignore all tilts, decentrations and clear apertures assigned to the
surface #1. Issued with a "?", the "TEL" command returns a message
as to the current setting. This command is "sticky" and remains as
set for the current lens until changed by the user. The setting is
stored with the current lens in the lens database. While "TEL" is
"(ON or YES)", reassignment of the object, reference and image
surface with numeric word #5 of the "FOB" command is not allowed.
While "TEL" is "(ON or YES)", the absolute value of the object
distances (surface 0 thickness) must be less than
1.0X10</span><span class="c38 c47">10</span><span class=

<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8">APLANATIC RAY AIMING</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">AIMAPL (ON or YES or OFF or
NO)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - The "AIMAPL (ON or YES)" and
"AIMAPL (OFF or NO)" commands either activate or deactivate real
ray, aplanatic ray aiming. When ray aiming is "on" and aplanatic
ray aiming is "off", which is the default startup setting for the
program, real rays are iteratively aimed to specific relative x and
y-coordinates in the reference surface. When ray aiming is "on" and
aplanatic ray aiming is also "on", then real rays are aimed at x
and y-coordinates in the reference surface which are determined in
part by the radius of curvature assigned to the reference surface.
Aiming is performed such that if a uniform grid of rays was aimed
at the reference surface, that grid of rays would be uniformly
spread over the curved surface of the reference surface and would
represent uniform angular ray aiming at that surface with respect
to the center of curvature of that surface. If aplanatic ray aiming
is "on" but the reference surface is a plano surface, &nbsp;then
ray aiming will be performed as if aplanatic ray aiming were "off".
Aplanatic ray aiming also requires that there be a circular clear
aperture assigned to the reference surface and that there be no
clear aperture decenters and no clear aperture tilt assigned to
that circular clear aperture. &nbsp;The radius of curvature of the
reference surface must also be greater than or equal to the
semi-diameter of the circular clear aperture assigned to that
surface. The figure on the right illustrates non-aplanatic ray
aiming. In this case the y-height of the 0.5 ray at the reference
surface is exactly 0.5 of the y-height of the 1.0 ray at the
reference surface. The figure on the left illustrates aplanatic ray
aiming. Here, the angle subtended by the 0.5 ray at the reference
surface (measured with respect to the reference surface center of
curvature) is exactly 0.5 of the angle subtended by the 1.0 ray at
the reference surface (measured with respect to &nbsp;the reference
surface center of curvature).</span></p>

"MYGLASS" definition with the new user-defined glass name being the
previous glass name. After this occurs, no automatic interpolation
of indices with wavelength changes will take place. &nbsp;The
"THERM GLASS" and "THERM GAS" commands allows the user to define

<p class="c6"><span class="c0">SAVE AND RESTORE
LENSES</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The next four commands
describe an alternate way to save lens prescriptions when it is not
desired to use the lens library structure.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LENSLOC (6-character directory
name)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - The "LENSLOC" command, issued
with exactly 6 characters, designates the directory name, under the
main program directory, wherein lenses will be saved to and
retrieved from with the next issuances of “LENSSAVE” and “LENSREST”
commands. Issued with a “?”, the current LENSLOC directory name
will be displayed. The default lens directory name is
“LENSES”.</span></p>
<hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LENSDIR</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "LENSDIR" command is issued in order to list the
contents of the current lens storage directory.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LENSSAVE
(filename)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - &nbsp;The "LENSSAVE"
command, issued with a one to eight character file name, causes the
current lens to be saved as an ASCII file with the file extension
.PRG into the current lens storage directory. If the "LENSSAVE"
command is issued with the file name "ABC" for example, the current
lens will be saved in the file ABC.PRG in the lens storage
directory. Existing optimization and tolerance definitions are
automatically saved as well.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LENSREST
(filename)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - &nbsp;The "LENSREST"
command, issued with a one to eight character file name, causes the
lens stored in that named ASCII file, in the current lens storage
directory, to be restored as the current lens. If the "LENSREST"
command is issued with the file name "ABC" for example, then if the
file ABC.PRG exists in the current lens storage directory, the lens
data in that file will become the lens data for the new current
lens. Previously saved optimization and tolerance definitions are
automatically reloaded as well.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LSAVE
(filename)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - &nbsp;The "LSAVE"
command works exactly like the LENSSAVE command except that no
OPTIMIZATION, TOLERANCING, FIELDS or RAYS data is saved with the
lens data.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">THE LENS LIBRARY</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">LENS LIBRARY
INITIALIZATION</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The lens library is
initially created by entering the next CMD level
command.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">ILF</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- To avoid accidental destruction of the existing lens
library, the "ILF" command performs no file initialization unless
it is &nbsp;followed immediately by the command:</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">PROCEED</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- If the CMD level command "PROCEED" is not immediately
entered following the "ILF" command, then the "ILF" command is
ignored and canceled.</span> <span class="c3">THIS INITIALIZATION
PROCEDURE SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION AS LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA MAY
BE LOST IF IT IS USED CARELESSLY.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;The
"ILF" command is intended for a user who has no lens library or for
a user who intentionally desires to clean the slate and begin anew
with an empty lens library.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">LENS LIBRARY
COMMANDS</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The program lens library
routines provide a lens library for the storage and retrieval of
optical systems. The lens library serves as permanent optical
system data storage. The number of lenses which may be stored is
limited to a maximum of 999. Lens data may be entered into the
library at any time following lens input or modification. Lens
retrieval may be requested at any time at the CMD level. If they
exist at the time of lens storage, optimization and tolerance
definitions are saved in the lens library along with the lens. If
optimization and tolerance definitions were save with a lens, they
will be retrieved when the lens is retrieved.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LIB P</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">LIB P ,
i</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">LIB P
, i , j</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "LIB P" command displays
a directory listing of all or part of the lens library. Without
numeric input, the entire contents of the lens library directory is
displayed. If only "i" is entered, only the "i"th lens library
directory entry will be displayed. If "i" and "j" are both entered,
the lens library directory from entry "i" to entry "j" will be
displayed. "i" and "j" may range from 1 to 999. The display
consists of the current lens identifier and a time and date
stamp.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LIB PUT (Optional string which
becomes the new Lens Identifier LI which is used as the new lens
library label)</span> <span class="c3">or</span> <span class=
"c8 c18">LIB PUT , i &nbsp;(Optional string which becomes the new
Lens Identifier LI which is used as the new lens library
label)</span> <span class="c3">- The "LIB PUT" command causes the
current lens to be stored in the lens library. If "i" is entered,
storage will be attempted in the "i"th lens library storage area.
If "i" is not explicitly entered, the current lens will be stored
in the first empty lens library location found.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LIB GET</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">LIB GET ,
i</span><span class="c3">The "LIB GET" command causes the contents
of the "i"th lens library location to be retrieved as the new
current lens. The old current lens will be lost.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LIB DEL , i</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">LIB DEL , i ,
j</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "LIB DEL" command causes the
"i"th lens library entry to be deleted. If both "i" and "j" are
entered, lens library entries from "i" through "j" will be
deleted.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LSTAT</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "LSTAT" command generates a display of the current
lens library storage status.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">MANIPULATING
&nbsp;LIBRARIES</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The following
commands are used to save and restore the contents of the current
lens library dircetory. These two next two commands should not be
used for saving and restoring the lens library when updating the
program. The behavior of these commands in this situation is not
reliable and alternate lens libraries will be lost!</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LIBSAVE</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The command "LIBSAVE" causes the contents of the
current lens library directory to be saved in the ASCII file
LIBSAV.DAT. This process erases the current contents of the
EDITTEXT.DAT file and the previous contents of the LIBSAV.DAT
file.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LIBREST</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The command "LIBREST" causes the contents of the
current LIBSAV.DAT file to be loaded into the current lens library
directory. This process erases the current contents of the
EDITTEXT.DAT file and the previous contents of the current lens
library directory.</span></p>
<hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">COMMERCIAL LENS MANUFACTURER
LIBRARIES</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- There are a number of lens
manufacturers who provide large selections of optical components in
finished form. Many times it is useful to be able to insert the
optical prescriptions of these components into an existing optical
system prescription or to build an entirely new optical system from
these "off-the-shelf" components. In order to provide a simple
method for selection and retrieval of these prescriptions, the
following commands are provided:</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LIB PMG</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">LIB

PRO</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">LIB
PSH</span> <span class="c5">-</span> <span class=
"c3 c14">These</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;four commands work the
same as the "LIB P" command, except that they provide listings of
the lens libraries which store optical components from MELLES
GRIOT, EDMUND SCIENTIFIC, NEWPORT CORPORATION, ROLYN OPTICS COMPANY
and SPINDLER & HOYER.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LIB GETMG , i</span>
<span class="c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">LIB GETES ,
i</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">LIB
GETNC , i</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class=
"c8 c18">LIB GETRO , i</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;or</span>
<span class="c8 c18">LIB GETSH , i</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;-
These four commands work the same as the "LIB GET" command, except
that they cause the "i"th lens in the specified lens library to be
retrieved as the current lens. The previous current lens will be
lost unless it has been previously saved. Using the CMD level
command "LENADD", the current lens and the lens being retrieved may
be added together. The qualifiers "GETMG", "GETES", "GETNC" "GETRO"
and "GETSH" refer to MELLES GRIOT, EDMUND SCIENTIFIC, NEWPORT
CORPORATION, ROLYN OPTICS COMPANY and SPINDLER & HOYER. &nbsp;These
manufacturer lens libraries are provided only as a convenience to
the user and do not constitute a product endorsement.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">OPTICAL GLASS CATALOGS</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">GLASSP</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "GLASSP" command, entered without a qualifier,
displays the names of all the currently implemented optical glass
libraries.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">GLASSP (catalog
name)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - The "GLASSP" command, entered
with a valid glass catalog name, displays the names and/or numbers
of all of the current optical glasses in that catalog.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">GLASSP (catalog name) (glass
name)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp; - The "GLASSP" command, entered
with a valid glass catalog name and a valid optical glass name,
displays additional information about that glass. The glass name is
entered as an alphanumeric string. &nbsp;Issuing the "GLASSP"
command with the catalog name "USER" causes the default text editor
to open the USER.DAT file.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">LENS SCALING COMMANDS</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">SC , factor , i ,
j</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">WSC ,
factor , i , j</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "SC" and "WSC"
commands are used to scale the current lens from surface "i" to
surface "j" by the "scale factor". If "j" is not input, the ending
surface is assumed to be the image surface. The use of "WSC" rather
than "SC" results in no scaling of the SCX, SCY, SAX or SAY
values.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">SC FY , efl , i ,
j</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">WSC
FY , efl , i , j</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "SC FY" and
"WSC FY" commands act exactly as the "SC" and "WSC" commands do,
except that they act to scale the lens so that the YZ-plane
paraxial effective focal length will equal the "efl" value input in
numeric word 1. If no efl can be calculated, an error message will
be issued and no action will be taken. Only special surface
coefficients associated with special surface TYPES 1, 4, 6, 7, 8,
12 and 13 are scaled via these four scaling commands.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">LENS OUTPUT AND DISPLAY</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LENO</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "LENO" command outputs all data for the current
lens and all current multiple configuration and special surface
data in a format which is readable as program input. If the output
is read by the program, then the "LENO" command should be preceded
by "OUTPUT CP", "OUTPUT PU" or OUTPUT ED". If the output is to be
printed, then "LENO" should be preceded by "OUTPUT LP". Existing
optimization and tolerance definitions are automatically output as
well.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LENO NOOPT</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "LENO NOOPT" command outputs all data for the
current lens and all current multiple configuration and special
surface data in a format which is readable as program input. If the
output is read by the program, then the "LENO NOOPT" command should
be preceded by "OUTPUT CP", "OUTPUT PU" or OUTPUT ED". If the
output is to be printed, then "LENO NOOPT" should be preceded by
"OUTPUT LP". Existing optimization and tolerance definitions are
NOT output.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LENO RD</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "LENO RD" command outputs all data for the current
lens and all current multiple configuration and special surface
data in a format which is readable as program input. It works
exactly as does "LENO" except for surfaces with non-zero curvatures
or toric curvatures. For those surfaces, surface radius or toric
radius are output.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c34"><span class="c8 c18">LENO REVERSE</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "LENO REVERSE" command outputs the lens data of
the current lens in reverse order. Only the main lens configuration
is reversed. All PIKUPs, solves, tilts, decentrations and alternate
configurations are first removed. Should a configuration, other
than the main configuration, need reversal, use the "DEZOOM"
command to change the alternate configuration into the main
configuration. If a complex set of adjacent reflectors is found,
LENO REVERSE will do its best to identify glasses surrounding the
reflectors. If it can not resolve the glasses, the glass "GLASS
UNKNOWN" with unit refractive indices will be used and the user
will need to change that glass to the correct glass by hand with
UPDATE LENS commands.</span></p>
<hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">LENS CONVERSION</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- No two optical design programs support all the same
optical modeling features. Most programs have some commonality of
data types although not all command syntax is the same. The
following translators, may be used to translate optical
prescriptions to and from this program's lens database. Use these
translators with caution and check all translated data in the
target optical design program. Any errors in these translators
should be reported immediately so that they may be fixed. Output
may be performed to the screen or to one of the output files via
the CMD level command "OUTPUT". CODE-V and ZEMAX database items not
translated using the "CV2PRG" and ZMX2PRG" commands will be stored
in a file named CONVERT.ERR so that after conversion, the user can
see what the translator has not translated.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LENO AC</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "LENO AC" command outputs the lens data of the
current lens in a form in which it may be imported into ACCOS-V
optical design program. Only the main lens configuration is output.
All PIKUPs, solves, and alternate configurations are first removed.
Some of this program's features are not supported in ACCOSS-V and
it is up to the user to verify the translation accuracy. All
glasses are converted to the ACCOS-V "GLASS" command. The decenters
and tilts of clear apertures and obscurations are ignored. "CLAP
and COBS ERASES" are ignored. Special surface definitions are
ignored.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LENO CV</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- The "LENO CV" command outputs the lens data of the
current lens in a form in which it may be imported into CODE-V
optical design program. Only the main lens configuration is output.
All PIKUPs, solves, and alternate configurations are first removed.
Some of this program's features are not supported in CODE-V and it
is up to the user to verify the translation accuracy. All glasses
are converted to the CODE-V "GLASS" command. The decenters and
tilts of clear apertures and obscurations are retained. "CLAP and
COBS ERASES" are ignored. Special surface definitions are ignored.
"TILT BEN" and "TILT DAR" commands are translated but "TILT RET"
and "PIVOT" are ignored.</span></p>
<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LENO EXCEL ( i , j , glo , cfg
)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "LENO EXCEL" command outputs
the lens data of the current lens in a tab delimited file which may
be read into Microsoft Excel. Data items which are all default, are
omitted. For example, if there are no conics in the surface range
requested, no conic column is output. Data is output from surface
"i" to surface "j". Defaults for "i" and "j" are surfaces 1 and the
image surface. "glo" specifies the global reference surface for
global vertex data. The default is surface 1. "cfg" specifies the
configuration to output. The default is cfg 1.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">CV2PRG

converts the ZEMAX</span><span class="c13">™</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;ASCII file representation of a lens contained in the
file named “filename” into the “current” lens. Not all
ZEMAX</span><span class="c13">™</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;lens

<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">COMBINING LENSES</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">LENADD , &nbsp;i , j ,
k</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The "LENADD" command will add on
to the end of the current lens (called the first lens) the lens
stored in the lens library block "i" (called the second lens) and
the resultant lens will become the new current lens. The lens units
must be the same for both lenses. The lens identification,
wavelengths, spectral weights, control wavelength and paraxial
trace parameters (SAY, SAX, SCY or SCY FANG and SCX or SCX FANG)
will continue to be what they were for the first lens. All solves
will be removed, but all PIKUPs will remain. The aperture stop will
remain that of the first lens unless "j" is non-blank, in which
case the aperture stop of the second lens will become the aperture
stop for the new lens. The reference surface of the new lens will
remain that of the first lens unless "k" is non-blank, in which
case the reference surface of the second lens will become the
reference surface of the new lens. Any holds on f/# or exit pupil
radius will remain with the first lens. The mode will remain with
the second lens. All special surface data will remain
intact,</span> <span class="c8">but all alternate configurations
associated with either lens will be lost</span><span class=
"c3">.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c0">DISPLAYING LENS
DATA</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- The following commands generate
the display of various items of the lens database. The qualifier
words "OB" or "OBJ" cause data to be displayed for the object
surface only. If no qualifier word is entered, a line of data is
produced for the surface whose number "i" is specified by numeric
word #1. If a negative value is entered for "i", the program
increases the entered value by adding the number of the image
surface. Thus, an entry of -1 may be used to denote the surface
immediately preceding the image surface. These commands are also
described in the sections with deal with the modification of these
specific lens database items.</span></p>
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">HEADINGS ON</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;or</span> <span class="c8 c18">HEADINGS
OFF</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;- Headings are always displayed
when tabular output is requested via the qualifier "ALL". The
"HEADINGS" command with the qualifier words "ON" and "OFF" controls
whether or not headings will be displayed for single lines of
displayed data. The default setting for "HEADINGS" is "OFF" when
the program begins. New users may be more comfortable seeing
headings for all data displays. Headings can be set to "ON" after
program startup or the line "HEADINGS ON" can be added to the
"DEFAULTS.DAT" file before starting the program. If requested
program data does not exist, a message to that effect is
displayed.</span></p>
<hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
<p class="c20"></p>
<p class="c34"><span class="c0">LENS DATA DISPLAY COMMANDS</span>
<span class="c3 c14">- The following commands can take "ALL" (all
surfaces) or "OBJ" or "OB" (object surface) as qualifier words or
they can take numeric wrd #1 input, "i" designating a specific
surface for which surface data is to be displayed. Issued with no
input, the data for the final surface of the lens will be
displayed.</span></p>

<span class="c3">The "RTG" and "CTG" commands produce output of the
surface profile (radius for "RTG" and curvature for "CTG"), the
axial thickness to the next surface, the name associated with the
optical medium following the surface (e.g., AIR, REFL, MODEL,
SCHOTT BK5), the refractive index, N at the control wavelength and
the Abbe-number V at the control wavelength and primary wavelength
pair. An asterisk (*) will be printed immediately preceding the
surface number of all surfaces which contain unusual properties:
tilts, decenters, a conic constant, aspheric data, torics or
special surface data. For this and other commands which follow,
"OB" and "OBJ" refer to surface 0. "ALL" produces a listing for all
surfaces in the lens database for which output would be
appropriate.</span></p>

(described in the CMD section) and the "LENO" command (described in
this section) to output the current lens data to the EDITTEXT.DAT
file. Use the "EDIT" command to edit this file, making any desired
changes. After filing the modified "EDITTEXT.DAT" file and leaving
the editor, read in the modified EDITTEXT.DAT file using the "INPUT
ED" command (described in the CMD section). The changes made during
the edit session will be manifested in the new current
lens.</span></p>

<p class="c6"><span class="c0">PARAMETER CHANGE
COMMANDS</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- Fifty one commands, when issued from the LENS UPDATE
LEVEL, may be issued with the optional qualifier words "CENT" or
"DELT". If one of these commands is issued with the "CENT"
qualifier word, the current lens parameter value referenced by the
command will be increased or decreased by the percentage specified
by the value of numeric word #1. If one of these commands is issued
with the "DELT" qualifier word, the current lens parameter value
referenced by the command will be changed by the value of numeric
word #1. Additionally, the "CV", "RD", "CVTOR" and "RDTOR" commands
may be issued with the qualifier word "DELTFR". "DELTFR" is used to
modify the curvature, radius of curvature, toric curvature or toric
radius of curvature of a surface to represent a change by a
specified number of "fringes". By default, the wavelength used is
0.5461 microns. If no clear aperture is assigned, then the default
aperture height used for "DELTFR" is the sum of the absolute values
of the paraxial marginal and paraxial chief ray heights in the
YZ-plane for the previous paraxial ray trace. If a clear aperture
is assigned, then the default aperture height used for "DELTFR" is
the larger of the Y and X-clear aperture heights, ignoring clear
aperture decentrations and clear aperture tilts. The wavelength in
microns may be explicitly entered via an explicit entry for numeric
word #2. The clear aperture height in lens units may be explicitly
entered via an explicit entry for numeric word #3. Furthermore, the
"CV" and "RD commands may be issued with the qualifier word "SAG".
"SAG" is used to modify the curvature or radius of curvature of a
surface so that it has a specific SAG value (in lens units) given
by the value input in numeric word #1. If no clear aperture is
assigned the surface, then the default aperture height used for
"SAG" is the sum of the absolute values of the paraxial marginal
and paraxial chief ray heights in the YZ-plane for the previous
paraxial ray trace. If a clear aperture is assigned, then the
default aperture height used for "SAG" is the larger of the Y and
X-clear aperture heights, ignoring clear aperture decentrations and
clear aperture tilts. A temporary clear height in lens units may be
explicitly entered via an explicit entry for numeric word #2. The
conic constant is used as part of this SAG calculation. The
following table lists these thirty-nine commands and the parameter
values which will be modified by them:</span></p>

lens database surfaces "i" through "j" appear in the current lens
database. During the "FLIP" process, all tilts, decenters, solves
and pikups are deleted in the surface number range. "FLIP" only
acts on the main configuration of the lens so if there are
alternate configuration definitions assigned to the surfaces in the
surface number range, they are not changed by the "FLIP" command.
"FLIP" also does not change any special surface
definitions.</span></p>

<p class="c6"><span class="c0">HUMAN EYE MODELS</span><span class=
"c3">&nbsp;- &nbsp;Many times it is important to be able to
simulate the aberrations of the human eye when evaluating the
performance of an optical system. Two long standing optical models
of the human eye have been included in this program. The models are
taken from MIL-HDBK-141 and from the Handbook of Optics. The
prescriptions are stored in the files HUMEYE01.DAT and HUMEYE02.DAT
respectively. They may be retrieved as the current lens using the
"INPUT FILE (file name)" command and then manipulated with the
"LENADD" command and the lens library commands.</span></p>

<span class="c3">- The "CCR" command causes a special type of
single surface corner cube reflector to be inserted as new surface
"i". This is a "pre-packaged" type of NSS surface which acts and is
drawn as a real corner cube reflector but only takes one lens
database surface to model. The "apex_length" is the perpendicular
distance from the base to the apex. The surface location is at the
CCR apex. The "apex_length" is only used to determine the location
of the base of the CCR for CAD and plotting purposes and is
measured along the local Z-axis. The nominal roof angles are always
90 degrees. The 1-2 lies in the local YZ-plane. The 2-3 edge lies
on the +X-side of the local YZ-plane and the 3-1 edge lies on the
-X-side of the local YZ-plane. Angle "errors" are entered in
arc-sec and is an error applied to the nominal 90 degree roof
angles. The reflection mode will set by the use of "REFL" or
"REFLTIRO" in the lens database.</span></p>

<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">ROO , apex_length ,

causes a special type of single surface "roof" type of surface to
be inserted as new surface "i". This is a "pre-packaged" type of
NSS surface which acts and is drawn as a roof reflector but only
takes one lens database surface to model. The "apex_length" is the
perpendicular distance from the roof base to the roof apex. The
nominal roof angle is always 90 degrees. &nbsp;The "apex_length" is
the perpendicular distance from the base to the apex. The surface
location is at the ROOF apex. The "apex_length" is only used to
determine the location of the base of the roof for CAD and plotting
purposes and is measured along the local Z-axis. The "error" is

<p class="c1"></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c8 c18">RAYERROR , ray error in

designates the current surface to be an imperfectly manufactured
surface for which random surface errors such as surface roughness
exist. The error is expressed as the one sigma ray angle deviation
in arc-seconds. The angular distribution of the error is assumed to
be gaussian but the gamma orientation is distributed uniformly. The
error is applied to a ray and to its associated differential rays
(if they exist). The error is applied after any other ray surface
interactions occurr. Issued from the CMD level, this command lists
all the non-zero RAYERROR settings in the current lens
configuration. If all RAYERROR settings are zero, no output is
produced.</span></p>
