Dear Ulf,

KODS is big do-loop to execute input command and display data.

Subroutine userinpt2 waits input then subroutine proces and cmder
execute input commands.

Graphics are plotted by my_plot from saved calculated data via
drawdatasave.

Thatâ€™s I remember the structure of KODS...

ENDO Michiaki
