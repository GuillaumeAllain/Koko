To Do List for KODS
===================

- read .agf glass data files directly

- fix utility/utility7.f:lwrite

- 'make' does not work well with Fortran 90 modules. Need better
  build system.
  
- random number generators are also from Numerical Recipes;
  subroutines 'ranran' and 'gasdev' --> replace

- replacement needed for sys_keyin.c (has not copyright)

- remove common block SVD2 (optim10.f and optim3.f)

- variable KODS_EDITOR, or some other way to configure editor

- need icons for app and GUI

- replace all subroutines from "Numerical Recipes"

- eliminate compiler warnings

- use writable USERHOME for files written by Koko

- implement Qcon and Qbfs polynomials for aspheric surfaces

- build and installation instructions

- Installation process and installation options

- in hardwar1.F: make setting USERHOME architecture independent
