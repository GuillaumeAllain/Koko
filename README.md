Koko Optical Design Software (KODS)
===================================

Koko is raytracing software for the design and analysis of optical
imaging and illumination systems. Koko has evolved from the optics
design program KDP that was made open-source by its original developer
James E. Klein (see KDP-LICENSE). The software provides the tools
needed to design, analyze, and fabricate complex optical systems:

* Focal and afocal optical systems
* Paraxial raytracing
* Sequential and non-sequential raytracing
* Spherical, aspheric, diffractive, and user-defined surfaces
* Multi-configuration raytracing (zoom lenses, interferometers, etc.)
* Spot diagrams, wavefront and aberration analysis
* Lens optimization
* Macro language
* Tolerance analysis
* Glass data from Ohara, Schott, Hoya, Corning, CDGM
* Test plate libraries
* Lens fabrication drawings


User Interfaces
---------------

Koko has a command line interface and a table-based graphical user
interface that will be familiar to users of commercial optics design
programs. A longer term plan is to integrate Koko into a workbench for
FreeCAD (<https://freecadweb.org>). This will enable a more
object-oriented approach to optics design and will also provide an
integrated optical and mechanical design capability.
