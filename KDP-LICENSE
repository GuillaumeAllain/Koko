HI,

AS LONG AS YOU CHANGED THE NAME FROM KDP (KLEINâ€™S DESIGN PROGRAM) TO
SOMETHING ELSE, THEN YOU HAVE YOUR VERY OWN OPTICAL DESIGN PROGRAM
WHICH YOU MAY CHANGE, SELL, GIVE AWAY OR ANY OTHER DISTRIBUTION METHOD
YOU CHOOSE BUT REMEMBER, IF YOU HAVE A CUSTOMER WITH QUESTIONS, YOU
SUPPORT THEM, NOT ME.

YOU OWE ME NOTHING AS I HAVE MADE KDP-2 FREE AND FREE MEANS FREE.

TAKE MY NAME OFF IT BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE ANYTHING, INCLUDING THE OS,
THERE WOULD BE NO WAY FOR ME TO SUPPORT IT AND I HAVE NOT USED LINUX
OR UNIX IN 12 YEARS.

I WISH YOU THE BEST.

SINCERELY,

JIM KLEIN


AS LONG AS YOU TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU AND YOUR PARTNER
DO WITH IT AND NO ONE BOTHERS ME WITH QUESTIONS, YOU HAVE MY
PERMISSION TO DO ANYTHING YOU WANT WITH IT. SELL IT, GIVE IT, ETC.

YOU MAY EVEN GIVE IT TO OTHER COMPANIES OR GOVERNMENTS OR WHATEVER YOU WANT.
